gimp-plug-ins
=============
###a collection of GIMP plug-ins.
As of now only one plug-in is ready - but it's pretty neat!

## Layer export
This plug-in will export your document's layers to the format specified in the *File pattern* field.
You can export the layers based on their visibility by toggling the *Visibility* drop-down.
Happy layer exporting exporting!
